# 5200-Project
MEAM 5200 Final Project

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

    lib/
    ├── kinematics/    # Forward and inverse kinematics implementations
    ├── trajectory/    # Trajectory planning and generation
    ├── vision/       # Computer vision and object detection
    └── utils/        # Utility functions and helpers

## Pick and Place Testing

The `pick_tester.py` script demonstrates the robot's ability to perform pick and place operations. It integrates:
- Computer vision for object detection
- Inverse kinematics for arm positioning
- Trajectory planning for smooth motion
- Gripper control for object manipulation

### Demonstration
